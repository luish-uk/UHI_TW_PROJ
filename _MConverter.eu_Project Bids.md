|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **As a team we have decided on the following project as our first choice:** |
| Web Game                                                                    |

<td><p>Our team has decided that web game would be a perfect project, we believe that a clicker web based game would be simple to do and be assessed on.<br />
<br />
As a team, we have discussed and talked about our past with javascript, we believe that a simple clicker game with upgrades depending on how many clicks you have would be an ample project for us to complete. This would suffice as a team project because it would let us learn more about javascript and how it works, it would also be a learning curve for our team and we would be able to communicate with each other and help each other with the tasks that are assigned. This would push us to have meetings and be more open with communication although we don’t know each other well.</p></td>

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **As a team we have decided on the following project as our second choice:** |
| Cryptography                                                                 |

| **Describe your interests and relevant skills and/or experience to explain why you believe this project would be the best project for you to work on**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Our project developer lead has history with cryptography, he had done this in his previous mobile app that he made and was assessed on earlier in the course. I believe that this would give us a good advantage and better understanding of what is necessary in this project. I believe that we would have better communication because one of our team members is more knowledgeable than others and can help with the tasks assigned. |
